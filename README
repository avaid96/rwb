rwb.tgz contains the project handout.   You need this.

fec contains detailed information about the FEC schemas and
data import procedures.  You probabably don't need this.
fec/ora/setup-all.sh is the script
that creates all the FEC tables in the cs339 tablespace.
Note that the FEC raw data is not included in the fec directory.
